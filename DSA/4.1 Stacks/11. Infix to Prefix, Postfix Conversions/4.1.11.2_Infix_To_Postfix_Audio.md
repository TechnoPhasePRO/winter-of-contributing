**Conversion of Infix expression to Postfix expression:**

**Algorithm for Conversion of Infix expression to Postfix expression ::**

1.Read the expression from left to right.

2.If the input symbol read is "(" then push it onto the stack.

3.If the input symbol read is an operand then place it in postfix expression.

4.If the input symbol read is an operator then 

    a)Check if the precedence of the operator which is in the stack has greater precedence
    than the precedence of the operator read, if so remove that symbol from stack and place
    it in the postfix expression. Repeat step 4(a) till you get the operator in the stack has 
    greater precedence than the operator being read.

    b)Otherwise push the operator being read outo the stack.

5.If the input symbol read is a closing paranthesis ")" then pop all the operators from the stack, place them in postfix expression till the opening paranthesis is not popped.The "(" should not be placed in the postfix expression.

**Note:**  

            1.If there are multiple paranthesis then they are evaluated from left to right.

            2.If there are different operators with same precedence ,check associativity of operators and proceed further.

**Examples :**

   *(A+B)*(C-D)             =>                        *AB+CD-*  
 *K+L-M*N+(O^P)*w/U/V*T+Q   =>          *KL+MN*-OP^W*U/V/T*+Q+
